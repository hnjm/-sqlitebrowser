## What it is

SQLite Database Browser is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.

It is for users and developers wanting to create databases, search, and edit data.  It uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and you don't need to learn complicated SQL commands.

Controls and wizards are available for users to:

* Create and compact database files
* Create, define, modify and delete tables
* Create, define and delete indexes
* Browse, edit, add and delete records
* Search records
* Import and export records as text
* Import and export tables from/to CSV files
* Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files
* Issue SQL queries and inspect the results
* Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application

## What it is not

This program is not a visual shell for the sqlite command line tool. It does not require familiarity with SQL commands. It is a tool to be used both by developers and by end users, and it must remain as simple to use as possible in order to achieve its goals.

## What's been done since the SourceForge project

* Qt3Support was removed
* Recent files menu added
* Improved UI, making it more modern, replacing some dialogs etc.
* Syntax highlighting for SQL code
* Cleaned up the code, reducing the SLOC quite a bit
* Added basic support for triggers and views
* Added pragma editing
* Added BLOB support
* Added a new filter row for searching
* Improved performance when opening large tables
* Extended the SQL tab
* Added SQLite extension support
* Fixed a ton of bugs
* Probably more

All in all a fair amount of the code has been rewritten in order to regain
maintainability.  Based on this quite a few bugs can be fixed and new
features added.

## What's still to do

* Even more code cleanup
* Further improvement of the UI, adding more features and making it easier to use
* Feel free to add more issues at

## Windows binaries

Windows binaries can be downloaded from here:

* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases

Nightly builds are also available at:

* http://rp.oldsch00l.com/sqlitebrowser/

## MacOS X

SQLite Database Browser works well on MacOS X.

* OSX 10.7 (Lion), 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and 10.9 (Mavericks) are tested and known to work

Building on OSX is simple, but requires SQLite and Qt 4.8.x to be installed
first.  These are the Homebrew steps, though other package managers should
work:

    $ brew install sqlite --with-functions
    $ brew install qt
    $ brew link sqlite3 --force

Then it's just a matter of getting the source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.git

**Note** - Don't clone the repo to a directory with a quote character (') in
it's name (eg ~/tmp/foo').  There's an open bug for that which [breaks the build](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/10).

And compiling it:

    $ cd sqlitebrowser
    $ qmake
    $ make
    $ brew unlink sqlite3
    $ mv src/sqlitebrowser.app /Applications/

An icon for "sqlitebrowser" should now be in your main OSX Applications
list, ready to launch.

## History

This program was developed originally by Mauricio Piacentini ([@piacentini](https://github.com/piacentini)) from Tabuleiro Producoes, as the Arca Database Browser. The original version was used as a free companion tool to the Arca Database Xtra, a commercial product that embeds SQLite databases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data.

The original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard SQLite 2.x databases. The resulting program was renamed SQLite Database Browser, and released into the Public Domain by Mauricio. Icons were contributed by [Raquel Ravanini](http://www.raquelravanini.com), also from Tabuleiro. Jens Miltner ([@jmiltner](https://github.com/jmiltner)) contributed the code to support SQLite 3.x databases for the 1.2 release.

Pete Morgan ([@daffodil](https://github.com/daffodil)) created an initial project on GitHub with the code in 2012, where several contributors fixed and improved pieces over the years. Ren√© Peinthor ([@rp-](https://github.com/rp-)) and Martin Kleusberg ([@MKleusberg](https://github.com/MKleusberg)) then became involved, and have been the main driving force from that point.  Justin Clift ([@justinclift](https://github.com/justinclift)) helps out with testing on OSX, and started the new github.com/sqlitebrowser organisation on GitHub.

[John T. Haller](http://johnhaller.com), of [PortableApps.com](http://portableapps.com) fame, created the new logo.  He based it on the Tango icon set (public domain).
